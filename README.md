# ChurnGuardML - Proactive Telecommunications Churn Prediction

## Project Overview

ChurnGuardML is an advanced project designed to revolutionize churn prediction in the telecommunications sector through the implementation of cutting-edge machine learning techniques. The project aims to empower companies to take proactive measures in retaining customers by accurately identifying and addressing potential churn risks.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of ChurnGuardML include:

1. **Churn Prediction:** Develop precise machine learning models capable of predicting customers at high risk of churning.

2. **Resource Optimization:** Enable telecommunications companies to strategically allocate resources by efficiently targeting customers likely to churn.

3. **Churn Reduction:** Contribute significantly to churn reduction by implementing proactive strategies based on model predictions.

## Project Structure

ChurnGuardML is structured with a focus on comprehensive analysis and model development:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** In-depth analysis to understand data distribution, correlations, and identify crucial features.

2. **Data Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, standardize data, and prepare it for effective model training.

3. **Model Building:** Utilize diverse machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), RandomForest, and GBTClassifier.

4. **Validation and Tuning:** Employ cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to enhance model performance.

5. **Performance Evaluation:** Assess model performance using metrics such as accuracy and area under the ROC curve.

6. **Model Saving:** Save trained models for future deployment and usage.

## Dependencies (Spark, databriks, RDD)

Ensure that the following Python libraries are installed before running the code:

```bash
pip install pyspark pandas numpy scikit-learn
```


## How to Use

1. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing:** Execute the EDA and preprocessing notebook to gain insights into the data and prepare it for modeling.

2. **Model Construction and Evaluation:** Utilize the model construction notebook to train various models and assess their performance.

3. **Validation and Tuning:** Improve model accuracy through the validation and tuning notebook, employing cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.

4. **Model Saving:** Save trained models for future deployment and ongoing usage.
